Past medical history is noncontributory. Both of her parents are still alive and healthy. She drinks socially and does not smoke. On physical examination, her temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse rate is 88/min, blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 18/min.

Palpation of the abdomen reveals the presence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Her detailed diagnostic workup, including complete blood counts, coagulation studies, and bone marrow biopsy, confirms the diagnosis of a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia, which is characterized by neoplastic proliferation of promyelocytes and good response to all-trans retinoic acid. The neoplastic cells are myeloperoxidase positive and contain azurophilic crystal rods. Which of the following genetic abnormalities is most likely to be present in this patient?",

    "question": "A 34-year-old Ethiopian woman who recently moved to the United States presents for evaluation to a surgical outpatient clinic with painful ulceration in her right breast for the last 2 months. She is worried because the ulcer is increasing in size. On further questioning, she says that she also has a discharge from her right nipple. She had her 2nd child 4 months ago and was breastfeeding the baby until the pain started getting worse in the past few weeks, and is now unbearable. According to her health records from Africa, her physician prescribed antimicrobials multiple times with a diagnosis of mastitis, but she did not improve significantly.

On examination, the right breast is enlarged and firm, with thickened skin, diffuse erythema, edema, and an ulcer measuring 3 \u00d7 3 cm. White-Gray nipple discharge is present. The breast is tender with axillary and cervical adenopathy. Mammography is ordered, which shows a mass with a large area of calcifications, parenchymal distortion, and extensive soft tissue and trabecular thickening in the affected breast. The patient subsequently undergoes core-needle and full-thickness skin punch biopsies. The pathology report states a clear dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells.

    "question": "A 62-year-old man with small cell lung cancer undergoes radiation therapy. His oncologist explains that radiation causes DNA damage and double strand breaks and this damage stops the cancer cells from growing because they can no longer replicate their DNA. One key mediator of this process is a cell cycle regulator called P53, which is upregulated after DNA damage and helps to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. One mechanism by which P53 activity is increased is a certain chromatin modification that loosens DNA coiling allowing for greater transcription of the proteins within that region of DNA. Which of the following enyzmes most likely causes the chromatin modification described in this case?",
