    "question": "An investigator has conducted a prospective study to evaluate the relationship between asthma and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). She stratifies her analyses by biological sex and observed that among female patients, asthma was a significant predictor of MI risk (hazard ratio = 1.32, p < 0.001). However, among male patients, no relationship was found between asthma and MI risk (p = 0.23). Which of the following best explains the difference observed between male and female patients?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision loss. She was reading a magazine this afternoon when she started having trouble seeing out of her left eye.
